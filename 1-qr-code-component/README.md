## My process
On the design previews I roughed in how I would segment the contents of the page into divs, headers, and other text elements. Then I continued building from the outside in, or from general to specific.

### What I learned
There are many more options to style then there were a few years ago :wink:

### Continued development
I need to look into when to use which units for font-size as well as when to use the viewport size as a unit.
